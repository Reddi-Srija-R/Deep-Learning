## Deep Learning Projects

This repository contains various deep learning models for different applications, including speech emotion recognition, image classification, and outfit recommendation. Below you will find descriptions of each project.

`Project Overview`

#### Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)

- Description: This project aims to recognize emotions from speech audio files. The model is trained on the RAVDESS dataset.

- Dataset: [RAVDESS Emotional Song Audio Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-song-audio)

- "Emotion_Recognition.html" - Contains code for training and evaluating the speech emotion recognition model.
  
#### Image Classification with CNN

- Description: This project classifies images into various categories such as tops, shirts, pants, accessories, shoes, etc., using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

- Dataset: Polyvore Fashion Dataset - Fashion images categorized into different types.

- "CNN.ipynb" - Code for building, training, and evaluating the CNN model.
    
#### Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) for Outfit Recommendations

- Description: This project recommends outfits based on the occasion (business, formal, casual, party) using Neural Collaborative Filtering.

- Dataset: Fashion-related data for collaborative filtering.

- "NCF.ipynb" - Code for the NCF model used to generate outfit recommendations.
